        <h1>Reflection on Learning CSS</h1>

        <p>Throughout the lessons on CSS, I learned a lot about how to style web pages and make them look more visually appealing. In the beginning, I found it a bit overwhelming with all the different ways to apply stylesâ€”whether itâ€™s inline, embedded, or external stylesheetsâ€”but as we went along, it became clearer how each method works. I really enjoyed learning about CSS syntax and selectors because it was exciting to see how simple changes to the code could instantly alter how a webpage looked.</p>

        <p>One of the lessons that stood out to me was working with the box model. It was interesting to learn about the different properties like padding, margin, border, and width, and how they all fit together to create a structured layout. It made me realize that web design is not just about making things look pretty but also about understanding how the elements are spaced and aligned on the page.</p>

        <p>I also had fun experimenting with typography and learning how to adjust fonts, sizes, and text styles. It's amazing how something as simple as changing the font can completely change the vibe of a webpage. Iâ€™m looking forward to using what Iâ€™ve learned in future projects, especially when it comes to making my website look more polished and professional.</p>

        <p>In the end, the lessons gave me a good foundation to continue exploring web design, and Iâ€™m excited to keep practicing CSS. ðŸ¥°</p>
