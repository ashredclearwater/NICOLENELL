        <h1>4th Quarter Reflection</h1>

        <p> I admit I found ICT really difficult since grade 8, although I will also admit I found this quarter the easiest compared to other quarters.
		I've learnt a bunch new codes which although, are complicated, are fun to do nonetheless. I greatly appreciate the memories this quarter and 
		even until first quarter. This quarter was sadly rushed, yet it will always be a place in my heart in which i will cherish , which includes you na rin miss!</p>

		<p> I perfected the summative, and who knows if I can also get a perfect or a really high score on the perio? Ths is the last time we're coding anyway, which makes me appreciate
			this quarter more memorable. Met a lot new frends along this journey, and I wouldnt like to change a thing. Since this quarter is ending, I wanna thank you talaga miss for 
				the opportunities that you have given us, like the remedials for chance. Thank you po for being an amazing ICT teacher to us po <3 </p>
<p> I'm gonna miss every time we go to the ICT room and then nakalimutan ko yung laptop number ko, I'm gonna miss it when I laugh after every Hands-On because I know I'll fail,
I'm gonna miss the times where we'll always say "MISSSS" when time is almost up in Hands-On, and I'll also miss a special someone miss HAHAHAH :3  </p> 		
<br>
<p> As this SY ends, from the bottom of my heart po, I LOVE YOU MISS, SANA WAG NYO PO AKONG MAKALIMUTAN NA LAGING BUMABAGSAK SA HANDS-ON AND TESTS NYO PO :3 (joke!!!) </p>
